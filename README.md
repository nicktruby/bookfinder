## Bookfinder - Angular (Typescript) SPA

This Application allow you to search for books from the Google Books API, and save them to your favourites.

This was my first introduction into Angular and second experience of working with Typescript. It a key exmaple of my ability to learn a new syntax in a short space of time.

Coming from developing in React, I focused my learning around how to implement similar functionality in the Anglular framework. This is included Routing, passing data using Inputs & Outputs, sharing data globally using services, *ngFor loops, two-way binding using ngModel and integration with Google Firebase for authentication and Firestore database CRUD operations.

## Features to Add

- Dynamically change the add/remove favourite button depending on whether the book is currently a favourite or not. And style it to the UI.

- Add more book details into the booklist component. Including a link to buy to e-book if available.

- Create a welcome page when first navigating to the app, providing an option to log in striaght away, or continue to find books without logging in.

- When not logged in and attempting to navigate to favourites, an alert is presented. Change this to navigate to a page instead, styled liked the app, displaying a similar message.

- Style the "page not found" page component to match the rest of the application.
